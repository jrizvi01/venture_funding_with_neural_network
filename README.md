# venture_funding_with_neural_network

## Backgound
This application creates a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Venture Capital firm.

## Usage
This application does the following:
 1. Prepare the data for use on a neural network model using a .csv input file.
 2. Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network and export     a model to an HDF5 file.
 3. Optimize the neural network model.

## Technologies
* Tensorflow - A free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

* Keras - An open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library
